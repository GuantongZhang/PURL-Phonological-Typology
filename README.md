# PURL-Phonological-Typology

This is a quantitative analysis of sign language phonological typology.

We are using two sign language databases composed of hundreds of individual signs from seven sign languages from different parts of the world to assess whether certain features of phonology (like specific phoneme forms, phoneme combinations, and phoneme distribution patterns) are universal among sign languages and/or among all languages (both spoken and signed).

This repository contains the code that has been used for the research conducted by Rachel Miles and Shai Nielson at the University of California, San Diego.
